# Mastermind Game

Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the other player (the code-maker). The code is a sequence of 4 colored pegs chosen from six colors available. The code-breaker makes a serie of pattern guesses - after each guess the code-maker gives feedback in the form of 2 numbers, the number of pegs that are of the right color and in the correct position, and the number of pegs that are of the correct color but not in the correct position - these numbers are usually represented by small black and white pegs.

# Getting Started

https://nadirao.github.io/Mastermind/

# Game Instructions: 

- Guess a secret code consisting of 4 colors
- X amount of hints will turn black if x amount of guesses matches the secret code
- Solve the secret code with 10 tries or less. the fewer the better :)
- You lose if you've use all 10 tries :(

# Next Steps

- Refactor Code
- Work on hints logic
